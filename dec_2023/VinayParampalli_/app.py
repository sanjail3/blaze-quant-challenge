  st.markdown("- Core Governance Tool: INJ empowers its holders to actively participate in the governance process of the Injective Protocol. Through a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) structure, INJ holders have the right to vote on proposals related to protocol upgrades, fund allocation, and changes to governance parameters. This ensures community ownership and fosters a collaborative approach to the protocol's development.")
  st.markdown("- Securing the Network: Staking INJ is a vital mechanism for maintaining the security and stability of the Injective network. By locking their tokens, stakers contribute to the consensus mechanism, validating transactions and ensuring network integrity. In return, they are rewarded with INJ tokens, incentivizing participation and securing the network's long-term sustainability.")
  st.markdown("- Facilitating Trading: INJ serves as the primary currency within the Injective ecosystem. It is used to pay transaction fees for trading various assets across different blockchains. This includes fees for placing orders, executing trades, and accessing advanced trading features. The use of INJ incentivizes network participation and generates revenue for the ecosystem's continued growth.")
  st.markdown("- Deflationary Mechanism: INJ boasts a highly deflationary structure, featuring a 2% burn mechanism. This means that 2% of every transaction fee is permanently removed from circulation, decreasing the total supply of INJ tokens over time. This deflationary model aims to increase the token's value and incentivize long-term holding.")
  st.markdown("- Enabling Access to dApps: INJ acts as a key to unlocking the diverse array of decentralized applications (dApps) built on the Injective Protocol. From decentralized exchanges and margin trading platforms to synthetic asset creation and prediction markets, INJ enables users to seamlessly interact with these innovative dApps and participate in the burgeoning DeFi ecosystem.")
  st.markdown("- Fueling the Ecosystem: INJ is a crucial component of the Injective Protocol's revenue model. A portion of the transaction fees collected through various activities within the ecosystem is used to fund ongoing development, support community initiatives, and reward contributors. This ensures the continuous growth and expansion of the Injective network into a thriving decentralized finance hub.")
