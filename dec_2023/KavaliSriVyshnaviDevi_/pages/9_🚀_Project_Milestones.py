        st.subheader("Multi-Collateral Dai (MCD)")

        st.markdown("**Broadened Collateral Spectrum:** MCD now boasts an expanded array of collateral types, including WBTC, USDC, and LINK. This strategic diversification not only enriches the collateral landscape but also enhances capital efficiency.")

        st.markdown("**Adaptive Stability Fees:** In a testament to its adaptability, MakerDAO has implemented dynamic adjustments to stability fees. These alterations, guided by market conditions and risk parameters, uphold the steadfastness of the Dai peg while fostering a robust demand for borrowing Dai.")

        st.subheader("Dai Savings Rate (DSR)")

        st.markdown("**Elevated DSR:** A judicious increase in the Dai Savings Rate serves as a compelling incentive for users to stow away their Dai, contributing substantively to the protocol's stability.")

        st.markdown("**Liquidations Across Vault Types:** The integration of liquidations across all vault types serves as a robust risk mitigation measure, effectively minimizing the likelihood of collateral shortages and safeguarding the Dai peg.")

        st.subheader("Governance Advancements")

        st.markdown("**Swift Executive Votes:** The introduction of executive votes expedites the implementation of sanctioned governance proposals without necessitating additional polling rounds. This procedural refinement not only accelerates the governance process but also heightens the protocol's responsiveness.")
