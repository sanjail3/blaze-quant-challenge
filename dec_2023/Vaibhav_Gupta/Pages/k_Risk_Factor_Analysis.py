    - Is GNO mining possible if not then what are the alternatives ?

    GNO cannot be mined, as creating new blocks to receive rewards is impossible. At its launch, the Gnosis team minted 10 million GNO. These tokens were then sold in an ICO event back in 2017. However, the current circulating supply is 2.6 million tokens and the maximum total supply is set at 3 million tokens.
    All available Gnosis tokens have been minted so it isn’t possible to mine GNO (create new blocks).
    GNO tokens can be purchased on the secondary market. GNO does not support staking or yield farming. 
    Gnosis allows users to create OWL tokens by locking their tokens in a smart contract. These locked tokens can’t be traded and the lock period and amount of OWL awarded varies. This is the only way for users to create OWL tokens and they are used to pay fees on the network.
