    - Vesting over 36 months from network launch.
    - Demonstrates a commitment to long-term alignment, with gradual token release to founders and early team members.

    **Pre-sale Purchasers (19%):**
    - Vesting over 18 months from network launch.
    - Purchasers contribute to Livepeer's financial runway, supporting the lean, engineering-focused core team.

    **Crowd (63.437%):**
    - Generated over 3â€“18 months using the MerkleMine algorithm.
    - Emphasizes a decentralized distribution model, involving the community in the early stages of the project.

    **Grant (0.213%):**
    - Immediately issued to a couple of early advisors and contributors.
    - Acknowledges the contributions of key individuals who played a crucial role in Livepeer's early stages.

      commitment to project success.
    - **Community Engagement:** The MerkleMine algorithm promotes community engagement, involving the crowd in the initial token 
      generation.
