This represents our best model, exhibiting a very high prediction rate on testing data. The training dataset underwent extensive cleaning, with the inclusion of additional parameters such as averages (Avgs), Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs), RSI ratios, etc., contributing to the model's exceptional performance.
