    st.header("I. Introduction:")
    st.write(
        "The Ocean Token (OCEAN) is a dynamic cryptocurrency designed to play a pivotal role in the emerging data economy. "
        "Its mechanics are geared towards incentivizing network usage, curation of data assets, and fostering community engagement. "
        "This analysis project aims to delve into the key components of the Ocean Token ecosystem, focusing on its mechanisms, revenue generation, "
        "distribution strategies, and its role as a unit of exchange."
    )

    st.header("II. OCEAN Mechanics:")
    st.write(
        "1. **Curation of Data Assets:**\n"
        "   - OCEAN holders can lock their tokens for the curation of data assets.\n"
        "   - This mechanism encourages community involvement in maintaining the quality and relevance of data within the network."
    )
    st.write(
        "2. **Burning as a Function of Network Revenue:**\n"
        "   - OCEAN is burned as a percentage of network revenue.\n"
        "   - The burning mechanism ensures a continuous reduction in token supply, potentially increasing scarcity and value over time."
    )
    st.write(
        "3. **Unit-of-Exchange:**\n"
        "   - OCEAN serves as a unit of exchange in the Ocean Market.\n"
        "   - The unit-of-exchange function is acknowledged but is not the primary driver of value according to the Ocean core team."
    )
    st.write(
        "4. **Generalized Design for Future Features:**\n"
        "   - OCEAN has a flexible design, facilitating the incorporation of new features.\n"
        "   - This adaptability reflects a commitment to evolving with the demands of the data economy."
    )

    st.header("III. Driving Traction:")
    st.write(
        "1. **Usage Volume and Network Revenue:**\n"
        "   - OCEAN is designed to thrive with an increase in usage volume.\n"
        "   - Higher usage volume leads to increased network revenue, part of which is burned and distributed to the community, emphasizing the importance of driving data consume volume (DCV)."
    )
    st.write(
        "2. **Data Farming Mechanisms:**\n"
        "   - Ocean Data Farming (DF) introduces passive and active mechanisms.\n"
        "       - Passive DF involves locking OCEAN for veOCEAN, earning weekly rewards.\n"
        "       - Active DF includes volume DF, where veOCEAN is directed to assets with high DCV, and challenge DF, a competition predicting ETH price.\n"
        "   - These mechanisms incentivize both long-term commitment and active participation in the network."
    )

    st.header("IV. On Network Revenue:")
    st.write(
        "1. **Baseline Revenue:**\n"
        "   - 0.1% of the value from consumed data assets contributes to the Ocean community.\n"
        "   - The independence from the currency in which data assets are sold emphasizes the network's inclusivity."
    )
    st.write(
        "2. **Future Revenue Mechanisms:**\n"
        "   - The possibility of adding new revenue-generating mechanisms underscores a commitment to long-term sustainability."
    )

    st.header("V. OCEAN Distribution Towards Traction:")
    st.write(
        "1. **Community Incentives:**\n"
        "   - A significant portion of OCEAN supply is earmarked for the community over decades.\n"
        "   - This distribution strategy aims to incentivize locking OCEAN and driving DCV."
    )

    st.header("VI. Unit of Exchange:")
    st.write(
        "1. **Role in Ocean Market:**\n"
        "   - While OCEAN functions as a unit of exchange in the Ocean Market, it is acknowledged that this alone does not significantly drive value, aligning with the emphasis on broader value drivers."
    )

    st.header("VII. Looking Forward:")
    st.write(
        "1. **Focus on Traction:**\n"
        "   - The Ocean core team's primary focus is on driving traction, especially DCV.\n"
        "   - Upcoming developments and additional revenue streams are anticipated to further enhance the ecosystem."
    )

    st.header("VIII. Community Development:")
    st.write(
        "1. **Diverse Teams:**\n"
        "   - Various teams within the Ocean community contribute to the ecosystem by building products that drive both OCEAN and DCV."
    )

    st.header("IX. Conclusion:")
    st.write(
        "The Ocean Token stands at the forefront of the data economy, leveraging innovative mechanics to drive traction and value. "
        "The commitment to community involvement, flexible design, and continuous improvement positions OCEAN as a key player in shaping "
        "the future of decentralized data exchange. As the ecosystem evolves, the emphasis on driving usage volume and community engagement "
        "remains central to the success of the Ocean Token."
